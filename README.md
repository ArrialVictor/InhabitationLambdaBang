# An Implementation of the Quantitative Inhabitation Algorithm for Different Lambda Calculi in a Unifying Framework

This repository contains an implementation of the parametric algorithm
${\tt Inh}_{\mathcal{U}}^{\tt G}$ solving the inhabitation problem in
the $\lambda!$-calculus with typing system $\mathcal{U}$. The
algorithm was presented in ... and the article examples are reproduced
here.

## Setup
This project has been developed with `Dune 3.0.3` and run on `Ocaml
4.14.0`. Both can be installed through Opam which can be found at the
[this link](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

## Run Article Example
Once both Ocaml and Dune have been setup, use `'make'` in the directory
to reproduce the article examples.

## Detailed Documentation
A (non-exhaustive) more detailed documentation can be found in the
[Documentation](/Documentation.pdf) file.
